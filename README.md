# CODSOFT
A repo for AI task set for my internship at Codsoft.

**Task 1**
TicTacToe AI:
With the use of Minimax algorithm integrated with alpha-beta pruning, I built a TicTacToe game that makes AI quite unbeatable. 

**Task 2**
Chatbot with rule-based responses:
Using pattern matching, I built a simple chatbot with fixed set of responses for the specific queries of the user.

**Task 3**
Image Captioning:
-Dataset:  Using the flickr8k dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k) for my model training.
-I used VGG16 model for feature extraction and caption is generated using the RNN model, LSTM.
-The accuracy can be increased further by increasing no. of epochs and training for larger dataset if enough resources available.
