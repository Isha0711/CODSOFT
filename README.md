# CODSOFT
A repo for AI task set for my internship at Codsoft.

**Task 1**
TicTacToe AI:
With the use of Minimax algorithm integrated with alpha-beta pruning, I built a TicTacToe game that makes AI quite unbeatable. 


**Task 2**
Image Captioning:
-Dataset: I used the flickr8k dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k) for my model training.

-VGG16 was used as the feature extractor and LSTM as the RNN that gives caption to the images. 
-BLEU score was used for evaluation.
